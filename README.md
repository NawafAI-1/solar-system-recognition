## 🧩 About the Project

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be integrated into a user-friendly, interactive web experience. It includes:

- **Dual input methods**: Use either webcam or file upload
- **Real-time prediction**: Get classification results with probability scores
- **Fully localized UI**: The entire interface is designed  with proper RTL (right-to-left) layout
- **Drag-and-drop support**: Upload images easily via mouse or touch

Whether you're testing machine learning models or building a prototype , this project is a perfect starting point.
